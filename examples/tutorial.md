# Tutorial

fluss is a framework that does not everything automatically. It supports different view technologies but is developed with
a view written in [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) in mind. So there is no automatic bindings and such.

In this example based tutorial we will recreate the app used by [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) and we will use React for the view layer.
It is a good example of an app that demonstrates several aspects of web app development without being too complicated.
The first step will recreate the app with all functionality described in the
[TodoMVC specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md). In the later steps we will
then add further functionality to demonstrate different aspects of fluss that are not covered by the original specification.

* [Todos - Step 1. The standard application](step1.md)
* Todos - Step 2. Undo and error handling (to be developed)
* Todos - Step 3. Server side fluss - storage (to be developed)
* Todos - Step 4. Collaborative todos (to be developed)
